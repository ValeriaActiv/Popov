<h1 id="header">My Startup Generated Almost 2 Million in Revenue, so I Shut It Down</h1>

<div class="new2"><p align="left">It was 2010, 6 years ago. I had that special moment while driving along the road in the city of Corona, in Southern California, just an hour east of Los Angeles. I concocted the idea. Then came the surges of butterflies, enthusiasm, passion, and excitement. The idea of something massive was planted inside of my mind, and I kept working on it (alone) with endless energy. The idea became larger and larger. It haunted me. I had to ‘create’ to scratch the itch. I sat in stasis, perhaps considering the cost of a new endeavor. Feeding this little creature may turn into a monster. Curiosity gave way, and I groaned and moaned, finally birthing something. Then that something needed a name. So, I named it. What could possibly go wrong?
Never name it until it is ready to get funding. Once you name it, you have to feed it and will never want to kill it.
(Sidebar: If you must name it, give it a name that can be killed. We will talk about being a ‘killer’ later, but your thing needs to be killable. Project #W462 (www.projectW462.com) is a great name; it means absolutely nothing. Your heart will go on if it fails. Founders tend to want to share their ‘named’ ideas, tell their family, friends, etc., who then want to say nice things and encourage you, which makes it harder to walk away.)
So this idea now had a name. I was working on it every night, so it took on a physical dimension (website, database, logo, URL, branding, code, etc). I spent way too much time on the dumbest little details. Don’t judge. You’ve done this too.

<p>The core of the platform was an innovation in the way people get things done in professional services. This market was 2 billion (which apparently is not large enough). <span id="span1">The platform was not the first to market in this </span> space, but neither was DropBox, (there were around 10 other file sync/backup services at the time of DropBox’s release). The work I started doing was to create something to impress, solve, and make a dramatic entrance. This was not the right step. I missed something. What did I miss? I didn’t listen to the data. What data? Oh right, I had none. I mean, I thought I had data. But looking back, it was more of a few hours of bookmarked articles and some downloaded data that I never really spent more than 30 minutes looking at. I think I studied my deductions on my tax return more than the business data. So in essence, I didn’t generate or find enough data, and then, I didn’t listen to it. I committed 2 cardinal sins, and then spent 6 years pivoting on the foundation of those mistakes.
You can’t pivot away structural mistakes.</p>
<p>This is primary to the plight of the entrepreneur. You must align a solution with a problem that is experienced by legitimate customers, spending or willing to spend legitimate money, on a solution that works with empirical data. Bonus: find evidence of a customer culture that reinforces your story.
We generated nearly 2 million dollars of revenue by the time it was all over. To the early stage startup founder, it may sound like we were on to something, but it was merely loose change from a leaky bucket. In our case, revenue was a vanity metric.</p>
